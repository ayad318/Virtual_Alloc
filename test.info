compile test using make tests and run test using run_tests

first I redirect my stdout to a .out file inside the tests_file using freopen() functoin.
I compared them with the .out files with .exp file that I wrote.

first I am testing the init with 15 inital size and 12 min size
and after that I am test the malloc giving in wrong input and som edge cases and normal cases
and after allocating I am testing free giving in wrong input and som edge cases and normal cases
and finally I am testing realloc giving in wrong input and som edge cases and normal cases.
